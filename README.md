three.js project for interview process

This was a three.js project I wrote as a technical take-home that was part of the interview process for a work term I applied for. It involves loading a .GLTF model of the Apollo onto a local host web server and writing software to orbit the model using the mouse and zoom in/zoom out using buttons. Note: The project specifications said that the zip file should contain a viewer.html file, I wasn't sure if it just meant a file that contained the viewer logistics or if it literally had to be named viewer.html. The default name for a html file for a .JS project is index.html according to the three.js document online. The documentation says that naming conventions do not matter, but when I tried to change the name to something else I ran into some weird errors. The project achieves all of the specifications in the document, so I assumed that the .html simply needed to contain the viewer logistics and left the name as "index.html".


Assuming three.js was installed using the recommended option 1 in the installation guide found at this link https://threejs.org/manual/#en/installation , Here are the steps to run this project: 

Step 1: unzip and extract this project to a directory in your computer.
Step 2: open a terminal in this directory and run the command "npx vite" and click on the local host link in the terminal.

Now you should see the webpage with the Apollo model. You can zoom in and out using the buttons or use the mouse/trackpad for more precise controls.
